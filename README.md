# Autoglosser

Contact Marco Raigoza (mraigoza@bu.edu) or Jonathan Fascetti (jlfascetti@gmail.com) with any questions.

Clone the repository (repo):

git clone https://github.com/jonathanfascetti/autoglosser.git

then in main directory, install packages with the command $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### How to run autogloss.py
  For command line interaction run:
      python3 autogloss.py "[INPUT TEXT]"
  Where [INPUT TEXT] is whatever word(s) or phrase you want to be glossed.
  For example:
    $ python3 autogloss.py "A Robert, A Bill náº½ John nonga a Mari wuusgo"
  With this example input, there should prompty be an output with the original input text, the normalized spelling and gloss, then LaTeX spelling and gloss. Depending on the input words, the output may return that there is ambiguity with orders deliminated by a slash

  Optional flags:

  -u
    If you would like to update the local .csv files for the glossary and rules. glossary.csv contains glossary contents pulled from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hht0h0BP-TeO_RHx07RF0UjK2VX-tcRU47bQ9FKS8Cw and
    glossaryrules.csv contains glossary rules pulled from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hht0h0BP-TeO_RHx07RF0UjK2VX-tcRU47bQ9FKS8Cw 
  
  -a
    Use when there is ambiguity in the input words or phrase.
    Depending on the word you would like to choose, use the -a flag followed by the idexes of how you want to handle the ambiguity. 
    The words that are ambiguous can be seen in the gloss sentence where all the options are seperated by slashes.
    For example, appending the following to your terminal call will choose the first input word to be the second ambiguous option and the third input word to be the first ambiguous option:
      -a 0:1/2:0
    Note that these indicies are indexed at zero and include all (even non-ambiguous) input words -- so count carefully!

### Repo overview
  * `/website`
    contains flask app to be run in browser.
  * `test.log`
    is the logging file from most recent time autogloss.py was run.
  * `/assets`
    * `/storyboard`
      contains two .tsv files with example sentences that have been used to test the autogloss.py.
    * `/glossary`
      contains helper files that autogloss.py calls each time -- used to make sure the main autogloss.py file is not too messy.
      If this program is to be adapted for another glossary, most of the changes should be in this script, not autogloss.py.
  * `autogloss.py`
    is the main python file that takes in sentence input (either from terminal or through web interface).
     The file can handle ambiguity and some (but not all) variations in input syntax.

### How to start application:
  There are two ways to run the program: through terminal or through the web interface.
  In terminal:
    Run the command:
      python3 autogloss.py "[INPUT TEXT]" -u -a [WORD INDEX]/[AMBIGUITY OPTION]
  
  In web interface: 
    In terminal, navigate to website/frontend.
    Run the command (add sudo if on mac):
      npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps (be patient, could take a while)
      npm run build
    Navigate to website, then run the command:
      flask run (Note: As needed run (python3 -m pip install [PACKAGE NAME])
